# Spike application loop — live state

**What this is:** Applying spike 010 (Mono Zen · Light & Dark) + the v2.0 MANIFEST feature decisions to the codebase, item by item. Each item runs a 4-step propose/go/implement/approve cycle. Same shape as `REFACTOR-LOOP-STATE.md` (A→I, now archived as complete).

---

## Resume prompt (stable — paste after `/clear`)

```
Read .planning/SPIKE-LOOP-STATE.md and follow its "Session start protocol" before doing anything else. Chat mode only — no pickers.
```

The protocol below is what makes the loop survive /clear. Keep it terse but follow it every time.

---

## Session start protocol (MANDATORY before any work)

This protocol exists because the loop's previous failures came from skipping it. If you skip a step, the failures will recur.

### Step 1 — Read this whole file
You're reading it via the resume prompt. Don't skim — read the item table, the Current Focus, the History, and the Pinned Rules.

### Step 2 — Scan MEMORY.md for applicable rules
`~/.claude-personal/projects/-Users-lucindo-Code-hrv/memory/MEMORY.md` — read the full index. For ANY propose-step, the following memories are PRESUMED applicable to this loop unless the item explicitly says otherwise:

- **[[spike-implementation-fidelity]]** — implement spike values verbatim; deviation breaks trust
- **[[spike-is-design-not-features]]** — CRITICAL; do not invent feature/data-model changes from spike screens. MANIFEST has the explicit feature decisions; nothing more is in scope.
- **[[spike-locked-values]]** — apply hex/values verbatim, never re-surface as OQ
- **[[design-logic-separation]]** — design must not touch state machines, audio, persistence, business logic (except MANIFEST-listed feature items)
- **[[copy-casing-is-not-design]]** — copy/wording is CONTENT; only spike-locked copy changes count
- **[[no-design-locking]]** — tests/code/comments must not anchor design tokens; new components follow the rule
- **[[propose-step-checklist]]** — every propose-step prints Section A (Downstream Constraints) + Section B (Applicable Memory Rules) BEFORE Goal/Scope/Risk
- **[[chat-not-pickers]]** — chat only; never use AskUserQuestion
- **[[ack-dont-fix-inline]]** — during a feedback dump from the operator, acknowledge first; don't edit until they say "you can fix"
- **[[use-lsp-for-renames]]** — symbol renames go through LSP rename-symbol or manual per-file Edit; never sed/perl/regex
- **[[v16-visual-locks]]** — the 12 operator-locked decisions in MANIFEST. **3+ days old — verify code-state claims before relying on them.**
- **[[v2-carryforward-disposition]]** — kept/dropped items. **3+ days old — verify before relying on them.**
- **[[orb-outer-ring-idle-only]]** — current Idle has a DEVIATION (extra outer stroke ring); spike orb has no extra outer stroke; J7 fixes this
- **[[dark-theme-token-collapse]]** — addressed by the new `borderSoft` token; verify on every dark-variant check

### Step 3 — Identify the next item
Look at the **Current Focus** section below. It names the next item and its propose/go/implement/approve step number.

### Step 4 — Read the spike artifacts for the current item
- `.planning/spikes/010-mono-zen-light-dark/README.md` — search for the section relevant to the current item (e.g. "twelfth pass" for no-jiggle layout, "fourteenth pass" for install banner)
- `.planning/spikes/010-mono-zen-light-dark/index.html` — locate the relevant visual implementation (token values, component JSX, layout structure)
- `.planning/spikes/MANIFEST.md` — Requirements section for the operator-locked decision (search for the bullet matching the item)

Spike values are **AUTHORITATIVE**. Transcribe verbatim; never paraphrase a hex code.

### Step 5 — Verify against live code before proposing
This is the discipline that failed in the first list draft. Memories are point-in-time snapshots; the codebase is live. Before proposing any item, grep/Read to confirm:
- The thing the item claims to add doesn't already exist
- The thing the item claims to remove still exists
- The naming/structure assumptions in the proposal match current files
- No related feature has shifted since the memory was written

If verification surfaces "already done" or "no longer applicable", say so and drop/revise the item BEFORE printing Goal/Scope/Risk.

### Step 6 — Apply the propose-step checklist
Print **Section A — Downstream Constraints** (what downstream tasks might this change constrain?) and **Section B — Applicable Memory Rules** (which rules from MEMORY.md apply to this work, including any cited above?). Then Goal/Scope/Risk/Verification/Commit message. Then **WAIT for operator "go"**.

### Step 7 — Implement on "go"
Per-file edits, run verification (tsc + lint + tests + build + item-specific grep guards), commit atomically, then commit the state file with the pinned commit hash.

### Step 8 — Wait for "approve" then advance
Operator says "next" or "approve" → mark item done, update Current Focus to the next item, commit state file.

---

## Workflow per item (same 4-step loop as refactor)

1. **Propose** — Section A + B + Goal/Scope/Risk/Verification/Commit message. Wait.
2. **Go / change** — Operator says "go", "continue", or proposes modifications.
3. **Implement** — Do the work, commit atomically, print a summary including verification results.
4. **Approve** — Operator reviews. "Next" advances; otherwise fix.

State below is updated after every step transition. The state file commits with each transition so the resume prompt always lands on truth.

## Items (in execution order — J1 → J18)

| Tag | Item | Status |
|-----|------|--------|
| J1 | Theme tokens — Nord palette → Mono Zen light + dark (cool slate, semibold-ready); add `borderSoft`, `orbHalo1/2/3`, `modalBackdrop`; remove old gradient + ring tokens | done (commit `be13fb4`) |
| J2 | Font system — Inter Variable + weight loading per spike (ultralight 200/300 for breath labels, semibold 600 for headings) | done (commit `0decf6a`) |
| J3 | No-jiggle PracticeScreen layout (anchored top group → flex-1 spacer → anchored bottom group, 16px min gap above Start) | pending |
| J4 | Orb body — 3-layer halo + center disc + asymmetric border-radii (organic-puddle); consumes `orbHalo1/2/3` + `accent`; replaces gradient + outer/inner ring | pending |
| J5 | Orb V2 minimal variant — single accent disc + faint halo, gated by **query-string param** (extend `featureFlags.ts`), NOT VITE_*. Default TBD by operator. | pending |
| J6 | Orb idle behavior (still vs ambient) — **query-string param**, NOT VITE_*. Default TBD by operator. | pending |
| J7 | Ring cue conditional — outer + inner ring visible ONLY on Running; hidden on Idle + Complete. Resolves [[orb-outer-ring-idle-only]] deviation. | pending |
| J8 | SetupCard primitive — V1 Grid 2×3 (1 row HRV/Navi, 2 rows Stretch); whole card is tap target with right-chevron affordance | pending |
| J9 | Settings sheet/modal primitive — bottom sheet on mobile, center modal on desktop; renders stepper, segmented, visual picker, toggle, accent button | pending |
| J10 | Wire SetupCard → Settings sheet → form rendering on Idle. **MUST preserve in-session extend-duration affordance** (currently the Increase button on the Duration stepper stays enabled during Running). | pending |
| J11 | FeedbackTime (HRV, big remaining time + small pace caption) + FeedbackCount (Stretch + Navi, big number + " of N" + uppercase context) primitives | pending |
| J12 | MuteToggle chrome alignment — `accent / accent-strong` → `borderSoft / textSoft`; 44px hit area preserved | pending |
| J13 | InstallBanner V3 — inline card, reuses SetupCard shape, mobile + idle only | pending |
| J14 | App Settings restructure into Appearance / Language / Audio / About sections (verify current section grouping at propose-time) | pending |
| J15 | Desktop responsive — centered column (520px practice, 600px Learn/AppSettings), orb scaled to 320px diameter, modal-vs-sheet for Settings | pending |
| J16 | Locked-copy verification — disclaimer / install banner / "Session complete · Take a moment" / 5 surface titles match `LOCKED_COPY` + spike-locked strings | pending |
| J17 | Final audit — 3-agent re-audit + grep guards + spike-fidelity walkthrough across all 5 surfaces | pending |
| J18 | **(Gated)** Complete screen — operator decision: ship as distinct surface OR keep current inline "Session complete" headline | pending |

## Current focus

**Item:** J3 — No-jiggle PracticeScreen layout (anchored top group → flex-1 spacer → anchored bottom group, 16 px min gap above Start)
**Step:** 1 (awaiting propose; J2 approved + committed)

When you arrive here fresh:
1. Read this whole file (you're here)
2. Read MEMORY.md and the rules listed in Step 2 above
3. Read `.planning/spikes/010-mono-zen-light-dark/README.md` — search for "twelfth pass" and "no-jiggle" (the layout-anchoring section)
4. Read `.planning/spikes/010-mono-zen-light-dark/index.html` PracticeScreen JSX — locate the three-zone layout (anchored top, flex-1 spacer, anchored bottom with 16 px gap above Start)
5. Read current `src/components/PracticeScreen.tsx` (or whatever the equivalent surface component is — verify the file name first)
6. Verify what layout pattern is currently in place; identify jiggle vectors (state-dependent inserts that push the orb up/down between Idle/Running/Complete)
7. Apply the propose-step checklist and print Section A + B + Goal/Scope/Risk

### Archived — Implementation summary (Item J2)

Self-hosted Inter Variable via `@fontsource-variable/inter` ^5.2.8. Three edits + one option pivot mid-implementation.

**`package.json` / `package-lock.json`:** added `@fontsource-variable/inter` to `dependencies` (runtime-bundled, not a build-time tool).

**`src/index.css`:**
- Added `@import '@fontsource-variable/inter';` as the FIRST line — before tailwindcss and theme.css imports, so the `@font-face` rules land in the cascade before anything else.
- Updated body font-family stack from `Inter, ui-sans-serif, …` → `'Inter Variable', Inter, ui-sans-serif, …` so the variable family is preferred while leaving a fallback chain for environments where it doesn't resolve.

**`vite.config.ts` workbox:**
- Added `woff2` to `globPatterns` so the bundled font files enter the SW precache.
- Added `globIgnores` for cyrillic / cyrillic-ext / greek / greek-ext / vietnamese subsets — app locales are EN + pt-BR only (both Latin-script), so those subsets are dead weight in the install. Latin + Latin-ext (~133 KiB) still precache.

**Option pivot mid-implementation:** initial proposal said "~50 KB woff2"; the default `@fontsource-variable/inter` actually ships all 7 unicode subsets (~218 KB woff2). Per-user runtime cost is unicode-range-gated (48 KB EN, 133 KB pt-BR), but PWA precache would include all 7. Operator chose option (γ) — `globIgnores` to trim the 5 non-Latin subsets from the SW install. Files still emit to `dist/` (any user who somehow needs them gets a live network fetch — same as today's no-font-loaded state). Saved ~85 KiB precache: 24 entries / 702 KiB → 19 entries / 619 KiB.

**No test changes.** Typography load is a runtime/visual concern; per `no-design-locking`, no test asserts package names, URL substrings, or font-family literals.

**No `index.html` edits.** Self-host stays out of the document head entirely.

**Out of scope (flagged for J17):** `vite.config.ts:28-29` still has stale Nord `theme_color: '#5e81ac'` + `background_color: '#eceff4'` in the PWA manifest — leftover from before J1.

**Verification:**
- `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json`: clean
- `npm run lint`: clean
- Full suite: 101 files / 1117 tests pass (unchanged baseline)
- `npm run build`: clean; `dist/assets/` contains 7 `inter-*-wght-normal-*.woff2` files (10 KB–85 KB each); `sw.js` precache: 19 entries / 618.75 KiB (was 24 / 701.95 KiB before globIgnores trim)

**Commit:** `0decf6a`

## History

| Item | Commit | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| J1 | `be13fb4` | Theme tokens — Nord → Mono Zen cool slate. 9 token values replaced + 6 new tokens added (`text`, `text-soft`, `border-soft`, `orb-halo-1/2/3`) in both light + dark. Deprecated orb-in/out + ring tokens kept temporarily (J4/J7 remove). Favicon synced across 3 sites. Inline cleanup: 2 value-locking tests dropped + 2 derived rewrites in `faviconPalette.test.ts`; lowercase word-bounded `slate` matcher dropped from drift-guard test (mono-zen vocabulary collision); 2 stale comment refs fixed. 101 files / 1117 tests pass. |
| J2 | `0decf6a` | Font system — self-hosted Inter Variable via `@fontsource-variable/inter` ^5.2.8 (runtime dep). `src/index.css` imports the package + body font-family stack now prefers `'Inter Variable'`. Workbox `globPatterns` extended with `woff2`; `globIgnores` trims cyrillic/greek/vietnamese subsets from the SW precache (app is EN + pt-BR; Latin + Latin-ext are the only subsets needed). Bundle: 7 woff2 files emit to `dist/`; SW precache 19 entries / 619 KiB (was 24 / 702 KiB before globIgnores). 101 files / 1117 tests pass; no test changes — typography-load is verified at runtime, asserting it would violate `no-design-locking`. |

## Pinned rules (do not violate without explicit operator override)

- **Chat mode only** — never use AskUserQuestion in this loop; design/visual work stays in plain chat per [[chat-not-pickers]]
- **Spike fidelity** — every value in the spike (hex, weight, gap, radius, copy in `LOCKED_COPY`) is authoritative; transcribe verbatim per [[spike-locked-values]] + [[spike-implementation-fidelity]]
- **Design is NOT features** — do not invent feature/data-model changes from spike screens; only MANIFEST-listed feature items are in scope per [[spike-is-design-not-features]]
- **Sealed layers stay sealed** — domain/audio/storage/hooks not touched except for the MANIFEST-listed feature items (theme enum reduction + chime→flute were done in prior milestones; remaining feature items in this loop = none on the domain side)
- **No design-locking** — new components/tests use behavioral assertions, not class-name assertions; new code uses tokens not literals per [[no-design-locking]]
- **Mandatory propose-step checklist** — Section A + Section B before Goal/Scope/Risk for every item per [[propose-step-checklist]]
- **Verify memory claims about code state** — memories are snapshots; grep/Read live code before relying on a memory's claim that something exists or doesn't
- **State file commits with every step transition** — so the resume prompt always lands on truth
- **No bundled items** — each item gets its own commit; operator can interrupt at any boundary
- **Operator feedback dumps get acknowledged first** — do not edit code mid-dump per [[ack-dont-fix-inline]]
