# Quick Task 260510-tc9: Bug fixes — Out-phase visual cue + bowl-cue decay duration

## One-liner

Equalized the inner reference ring with the outer ring (CSS, 2-line change) AND scaled the bowl-cue decay envelope with phase duration (synth + engine + hook + App), restoring symmetric In/Out perceptual cues at low BPM.

## Background

User reported two UX defects in the post-Phase-5.1 build:

1. **Bug 1 (visual)** — The Out-phase orb shrink has no visual reference comparable to the In-phase grow. The inner reference ring already existed in `BreathingShape.tsx` but `theme.css` rendered it at thinner border (1 px vs 1.5 px) and lower alpha (0.45 vs 0.6), so on a smaller circumference it read as a background detail rather than a symmetric arrival cue.
2. **Bug 2 (audio)** — The bowl cue was perceptually silent after ~3 s even though oscillators ran ~7–9 s, because `setTargetAtTime` is exponential decay (3×τ ≈ -26 dB). At BPM ≤ 3.5, each phase is ≥ 5 s and the user hears silence before the next phase boundary.

## What was done

### Task 1: Equalize inner reference ring (Bug 1) — commit `b267cac`

`src/styles/theme.css`:
- `--color-ring-inner` alpha bumped `0.45 → 0.6` to match `--color-ring-outer`.
- `.orb-ring--inner` `border-width: 1px → 1.5px` to match `.orb-ring--outer`.
- Added inline comment block citing 260510-tc9 Bug 1.

Hues preserved (teal outer, blue inner — semantic In/Out distinction is unchanged); only contrast magnitude changed. Two-line CSS change preserves the Phase 5.1 CSS-trim posture.

**Final values:** inner `border-width: 1.5px`, alpha `0.6`. Plan authorized biasing inner to `1.75px` if visual UAT shows the smaller circumference still reads weaker — deferred to manual UAT decision.

### Task 2: Stretch bowl-cue decay to phase duration (Bug 2) — commits `cd5f6cd` (RED) + `999eb8a` (GREEN)

Followed the TDD cycle:

**RED (commit `cd5f6cd`):** Added 3 new cueSynth tests + 1 new audioEngine forwarding test + threaded `phaseDurationSec` through existing scheduleNextCue assertions. Confirmed 3 failures from missing implementation (the back-compat clamp test passed by accident because doing nothing matches the default-τ assertion — that's exactly the byte-identical back-compat the spec requires, so it's a valid passing assertion).

**GREEN (commit `999eb8a`):** Implemented across 4 files:

- **`src/audio/cueSynth.ts`** — Added module constants `PERCEPTUAL_DECAY_DIVISOR = 3` and `MAX_TAU = 6` with rationale comment block citing 260510-tc9 Bug 2 and Direction A. Extended `scheduleBowlCue` signature: `(ac, when, dest, fundamentalHz, defaultDecayTau, phaseDurationSec?)`. Inside, `effectiveTau = phaseDurationSec === undefined ? defaultDecayTau : Math.min(MAX_TAU, Math.max(defaultDecayTau, phaseDurationSec / PERCEPTUAL_DECAY_DIVISOR))`. `effectiveTau` drives both `setTargetAtTime` and the `stopAt` / `cleanupAt` math so a stretched decay doesn't get truncated by a baseline-length tail. `scheduleInCue` and `scheduleOutCue` gained the optional 4th `phaseDurationSec` parameter and forward it through.

- **`src/audio/audioEngine.ts`** — Extended `AudioEngine.scheduleNextCue` signature to `{ newPhase: 'in' | 'out'; audioTime: number; phaseDurationSec: number }` (required, not optional — App.tsx always has a plan when scheduling boundaries). Forwards `phaseDurationSec` to `scheduleInCue`/`scheduleOutCue` as the 4th arg. `scheduleLeadIn` now passes `plan.inhaleMs / 1000` for the first In cue and consumes the `plan` parameter properly (removed the `void _plan` line).

- **`src/hooks/useAudioCues.ts`** — Updated `notifyPhaseBoundary` arg type to include `phaseDurationSec` and forwards it to `engine.scheduleNextCue`. JSDoc updated.

- **`src/app/App.tsx`** — Boundary scheduler effect computes `const phaseDurationSec = (frame.phase === 'in' ? plan.inhaleMs : plan.exhaleMs) / 1000` and passes it alongside `newPhase` + `audioTime` in `audioNotifyPhaseBoundary`. Inline comment block updated.

### Constants chosen

| Constant | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `PERCEPTUAL_DECAY_DIVISOR` | 3 | 3×τ ≈ -26 dB ≈ perceptual silence threshold; ensures the cue is audible right up to the phase boundary. |
| `MAX_TAU` | 6 | Cap perceptual tail at ~18 s (3×6). Longest valid phase at 5 BPM 40:60 ≈ 7.2 s; at 1 BPM 60:40 phase = 24 s. At 1 BPM the next strike arrives well before the prior tail finishes, but the cap keeps the synth from sustaining as a drone. |

## Verification

- **Automated:**
  - `npx vitest run` — 24 files, 316 tests passing (was 312 at baseline; +4 new tests).
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` — exits 0, no type errors.
- **Manual UAT:** The user's responsibility per the plan. Expected UAT matrix is below.

### Tests added

1. `cueSynth.test.ts › scheduleInCue with phaseDurationSec=10 stretches τ to ≈ 3.33 (10/3)` — long-phase stretch case.
2. `cueSynth.test.ts › scheduleInCue with phaseDurationSec=2 clamps to default τ (1.4) — short phases must not get a thinner cue than baseline` — lower-clamp case.
3. `cueSynth.test.ts › scheduleOutCue with phaseDurationSec=30 clamps to MAX_TAU = 6` — upper-clamp case.
4. `audioEngine.test.ts › scheduleNextCue forwards phaseDurationSec as the 4th arg to scheduleInCue/scheduleOutCue` — forwarding contract.

### Existing tests not weakened

All 28 pre-existing audio tests still pass with the new required `phaseDurationSec` field threaded through — no assertions weakened, only added new positional arg expectations.

## Manual UAT plan (user's responsibility)

### Bug 1 (visual) — Chrome desktop + Safari desktop + iOS Safari

| Step | BPM | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| 1 | 5.5 | Outer teal ring marks In-phase peak; subjectively "I can see the flip coming." |
| 2 | 5.5 | Inner blue ring NOW marks Out-phase trough at perceptually equal weight — same arrival-cue feel. |
| 3 | 3.5 | Both rings still read on long phases (slower scale change means the ring proximity dominates the perception). |
| 4 | any | OS reduced-motion ON + reload: orb frozen at MID_SCALE; both rings still visible. |

Plan's escape hatch: if UAT shows the smaller-circumference inner ring still reads weaker than the outer at equal alpha+width, bump `.orb-ring--inner { border-width: 1.5px → 1.75px }` (document the choice inline). Otherwise leave matched.

### Bug 2 (audio) — Chrome desktop + Firefox desktop + Safari desktop + iOS Safari + Android Chrome

| Step | BPM | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| 1 | 5.5 (baseline) | Bowl cue sounds substantively like before — short attack, gong-like decay over ~4 s. No drone, no rhythmic repetition. (At 5.5 BPM 40:60 the In phase is ~4.36 s; 4.36/3 ≈ 1.45 ≈ default 1.4 → clamp keeps default τ.) |
| 2 | 4.0 (user's reported boundary) | Cue still sounds natural and decays through the phase (4×0.4=6.0 s phase → τ ≈ 2.0 instead of 1.4; cue audibly stretches but still gong-like). |
| 3 | 3.5 (user's bug threshold) | Cue is now audible at the END of In phase (just before flip) and END of Out phase (just before flip). No silent stretches > 1 s before a boundary. |
| 4 | 1.0 (extreme) | Cue does NOT drone past the phase. MAX_TAU = 6 cap means perceptual tail ~18 s; next boundary at ~60 s. Sounds like an extended-tail gong, not a sustained sine. |
| 5 | 3.5 | Toggle Mute mid-In phase → bowl audibly fades out (D-08 preserved). |
| 6 | any | iOS Safari only: lock device mid-session, unlock, observe "Tap to resume" affordance (Phase 5.1 D-29), tap, confirm session resumes with no cue stuck on or replaying. |
| 7 | any | Firefox desktop only: no orb flicker regression (translate3d GPU promotion still applied in BreathingShape.tsx — unchanged). |
| 8 | any | prefers-reduced-motion ON: visual unchanged AND audio path unchanged (cues still play with stretched decay). |

## Carry-forward status

No new carry-forwards. Existing Phase 5.1 carry-forwards are unaffected:
- iOS audio resume affordance (D-29..D-44) does not consume `phaseDurationSec` — preserved.
- Firefox orb flicker fix (`translate3d` in `BreathingShape.tsx`) — preserved.
- D-08 mute fade-out — operates on the envelope GainNode independent of τ, preserved.
- prefers-reduced-motion orb lock at MID_SCALE — preserved (purely visual setting).

## Deviations from Plan

None. Plan executed exactly as written:
- Task 1: matched border-width (1.5px) + matched alpha (0.6); no bias-thicker variant applied (left as plan's escape hatch for UAT decision).
- Task 2: Direction A as chosen; `PERCEPTUAL_DECAY_DIVISOR = 3`, `MAX_TAU = 6` as specified; back-compat preserved (undefined `phaseDurationSec` → byte-identical synthesis).
- TDD cycle followed for Task 2 — RED commit precedes GREEN commit. No REFACTOR commit needed (implementation already minimal).

## Iteration 2 — Post-UAT (2026-05-11)

User UAT after iteration 1 surfaced two regressions:

**Bug 1 still visible** — screenshot showed orb at min-scale Out with no inner-ring cue.
Root cause was deeper than CSS stroke weight: the inner ring rendered BEFORE the orb
host in the DOM, so the opaque (opacity: 1) `.orb-layer--in` / `.orb-layer--out`
gradients occluded it at every orb scale. Equalising border-width / alpha could not
make an occluded element visible.

Fix: move the inner ring AFTER `.orb` in both `BreathingShapeBody` and the lead-in
mirror so it draws on top. Orb-edge now visibly approaches a fixed inner ring as
Out progresses; orb-edge coincides with the ring at MIN_SCALE = phase boundary
(symmetric to outer-ring cue on In). Commit `8b3e7d4`.

**Bug 2 character change + BPM=1 silence** — τ-stretch made the early-body
perceptually louder than baseline ("feels stronger / getting louder in the
beginning"), and at BPM=1 (30 s phase) the cue still went silent before the flip
because exponential decay toward 0 has no audible floor regardless of τ.

Fix: revert τ-stretch (keeps original onset character) and switch the decay TARGET
when phase > 3 × defaultDecayTau:
- decay toward `PEAK_GAIN × 0.15` (≈ -16 dB sustain floor) instead of 0
- hard fade-out (τ = 0.05 s, ≈150 ms perceptual) starts 0.2 s before phase end so
  the floor does not bleed into the next strike
- oscillators run to phase boundary + tail padding

Short phases (high BPM) take the original code path — byte-identical to baseline.
Commit `836f6e4`.

### Verification
- vitest: 318/318 passing (+2 new tests, replaced 3 stretch-tests with 5 floor tests)
- tsc --noEmit: clean

### Status
- Bug 1: ready for re-UAT (orb body Out phase, all browsers)
- Bug 2: ready for re-UAT at BPM 5.5 / 4.0 / 3.5 / 2.0 / 1.0 — listen for
  audible sustain through entire phase and clean handoff at flip (no audible
  decay-tail bleeding into next strike).

***

## Iteration 3 — Post-UAT (2026-05-11)

UAT iteration 2 surfaced 3 issues with the now-on-top inner ring:
1. Out phase: ring visible but low contrast against the blue gradient fill (pale-blue on pale-blue).
2. In phase: ring drawn on top of teal fill, distracting — In already has the outer-ring cue.
3. Lead-in countdown (digit): ring visible on the still teal pre-state orb, "weird."

Fix (CSS-only): inner ring is hidden by default (opacity 0), revealed only via
`[data-phase='out']`. 400ms ease-in-out matches the orb-layer crossfade — ring
appears in lockstep with orb teal → blue, recedes on the next In flip. Lead-in
has no `data-phase` on root, so the ring stays hidden through the countdown.

Color shifted from pale blue (low contrast) to deep indigo at moderate alpha
(`rgb(30 58 138 / 0.4)` = Out-text color at 0.4) — reads clearly against the
light-blue Out gradient. Indigo is paired exclusively with Out fill, so no
clash with the In teal.

Reduced-motion preserves the transition, mirroring the orb-layer--out contract
(D-07): the fade-in IS the Out indicator when the orb is locked at MID_SCALE.

Commit: pending.

### Verification
- vitest: 318/318 passing (no test changes — DOM structure + class names unchanged)
- tsc --noEmit: clean
