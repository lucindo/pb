//   - A single master GainNode all cues route through; mute ramps it.
//   - The lead-in scheduling primitive (3 ticks at +0/+1/+2 s + first In cue at +3 s).
//   - The boundary-driven scheduleNextCue dispatch (in → scheduleInCueForTimbre, out → scheduleOutCueForTimbre).
//   - close(): idempotent teardown that releases the system audio resources.
//
// Mute semantics (master gain):
//   - All cues route through a single master GainNode (masterGain → destination).
//   - setMuted(true): linear-ramps masterGain to 0 over 0.05 s (Safari-safe anchor
//     via cancelAndHoldAtTime, else cancelScheduledValues + setValueAtTime).
//   - setMuted(false): linear-ramps masterGain back to 1 over 0.05 s — INSTANT, with
//     no boundary wait. Unmute lands on whatever cue is currently playing.
//   - Cues KEEP being scheduled while muted (they play silently through gain=0), which
//     is what makes unmute instant.
//
// AC failure:
//   - createAudioEngine throws (rejects) when `new AudioContext()` throws. The caller
//     (useAudioCues) catches and falls back to visuals-only mode.
